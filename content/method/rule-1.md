## Rule no. 1: Make a project that makes sense and is based on a common purpose

This is the beginning of a knowledge base on open models to enable everyone to understand what are these models based on open source and open collaboration: https://github.com/Open-Models/Base

This resource is intended as a knowledge base freely available to all to help you grasp the concept of open models.

The objectives are multiple: to understand & disseminate the concept of open models, to broaden one's digital culture, to discover how to build an open project, to appreciate the potential of knowledge dissemination and collaboration on Internet...

Uses will emerge depending on who uses it and what ideas come to mind.

For the time being, the construction of this base has only just begun, with the beginnings of a plan for its content (https://github.com/Open-Models/Base/issues/1). It consists of defining the concept of "open models", explaining the history of the phenomenon and showing how open projects are structured.
