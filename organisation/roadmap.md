# Roadmap

Open models are subjects that evolve over a long period of time, from decades to centuries, it's a whole new world to explore.

The objectives around the brick of knowledge on open models are going to be to disseminate these models through educational work to acculturate the citizen of the XXIᵉ century, continue to build this digital common and federate an ecosystem of stakeholders around these dynamics to prepare for the future.

In an open logic, everyone is free to contribute according to their skills, desires and financial/time/geographical/etc. constraints. More details in the [contribution guide](guide-contribution.md).

## Training in open models

The brick's primary mission is to be a tool for education in open models to encourage the democratization of these emerging concepts. The digital concerns the whole of society, open models concern the whole digital world. Tomorrow, they could become part of general digital culture.

The need for education is abysmal, the subject of open models exists everywhere and nowhere.

The aim is to enable organizations involved in open models to reappropriate the brick: IT players, researchers and universities, teachers and schools, training centers, various organizations, industrialists, politicians...

This educational work will take many forms, from simply distributing the brick to enable individuals to self-train, to setting up training courses using the brick as a support, through a (video)conference, times of exchange and debate, through an educational publication on social networks, etc.

Providing education on open models to enable citizens from diverse backgrounds to best master this digital of knowledge.

## Building the knowledge brick

The knowledge brick isn't intended to be finished one day, but today the project isn't even an alpha or 0 version, the content remains an early prototype.

It's a basis on which to begin a relative acculturation, but it's still insufficient to fully grasp open models.

As a first step, at least 3 dimensions need to be built up further:

* The method for building a digital commons
* Individual pages on the various open models
* Pages on examples of open projects

One day there will be the question of building a truly collaborative platform, the technical environment of the brick is very immature.

A kanban allows you to see the developments in progress for [version 0](https://github.com/Open-Models/Brique/projects/1), which will be built according to the needs and problems that emerge with [GitHub](https://github.com/Open-Models/Brique)'s system of[issues](https://github.com/Open-Models/Brique/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/Open-Models/Brique/pulls).

## Federating an ecosystem of stakeholders

To carry out this education work on open models and build up this brick of knowledge, as well as recursively federating players, it will be important to work on setting up an ecosystem around this digital commons.

A whole range of organizations can benefit from understanding open models and then support these initiatives.

To make the project viable, one of the tasks will be to support the skills development of an ecosystem of players in the field of open models education, a trainer network who can then provide training within organizations or independently. Once the subject has been sufficiently mastered, it becomes conceivable to earn a living by contributing to this educational mission.

To carry out the work around the brick and open models, as these are major structuring and societal facts, as vague as they are complex, it's people from a multiplicity of disciplines who can come and shape this dynamic, and whose help will be critical in this exploration.

Open models are just an idea that's out there - shouldn't it be shared?

## The future

No one reading this will see the full potential that open models can offer.

Either - and this seems an all-too-probable scenario - our world will disappear, along with us, and open models will remain a dream we've only caressed. Or Humanity survive these troubled times by preserving the knowledge tool that is the digital and these are upheavals in our relationship with knowledge that will influence human society for centuries to come. A lifetime won't be long enough to observe their influence.

In fact, this brick of knowledge is destined to cease to exist, and to imagine mutating.

When open models will be democratized, if they begin to form part of a general digital culture, these subjects should be covered by an open digital university, based on open science and open education.

Here are a few ideas for the future: help produce the basic software for open models, create an ecosystem of strategic players to set up digital commons, advance certain models in more critical fields such as agriculture or energy...

Open models are a never-ending collective work.
